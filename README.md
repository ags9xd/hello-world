Name: Alexander Sarris

Background:
When an undergraduate, I took ECE 3430 (Intro to Embedded), SYS 2048 and 3048 (Intro to Electromechanical Systems, Integrated System 
Design), and MAE 4710 (Mechatronics). I have experience programming with Java, C, and Arduino (a mix of C and C++) languages, along with 
HTML/CSS with WordPress templates.  Coding projects I have worked on include software for thermal imaging goggles, the projects from ECE 
3430, a mini greenhouse project, line-following and beacon-following robots, a robotic arm for undergrad capstone, and website 
construction.

Interests:
I am very interested in learning more about cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things.  In this class, I am hoping to dramatically 
improve my knowledge of coding in C to more efficiently write programs for embedded processors  I also want to learn more about timers and 
interrupt / event handlers and how they work.  In addition, I am really hoping to become better at using Github, as this class will be the 
first time that I have ever used it for anything besides a reference for some of my side Arduino projects.
